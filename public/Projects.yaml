    Discover the Austin Future Climate Report 2024—our latest insights on how
    rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns will shape Austin’s
    climate. Explore future scenarios, impacts, and strategies for building a
    resilient city.

    In Austin, climate change is expected to cause hotter summers with more
    frequent heatwaves and fewer cold spells. Precipitation projections have
    high uncertainty, but the rainfall amount is expected to remain relatively
    unchanged. Austin is expected to experience more extremes, more variability
    in climate, and slight increase in windy days (fewer calm days). These
    projections are based on “high” and “business as usual” emission scenarios.
    A “high” emission scenario refers to model projections where emissions from
    human activities are expected to increase. A “business as usual” emission
    scenario considers projections where emissions are considered to remain
    status quo. For the projections, the output is based on medians, not
    averages, and presented for near-future (2021–2040), midcentury (2041–2070)
    and end of the century (2071–2100) epochs.

- title: Passive House Project

    The Passive House Project delves into both the potential energy saving
    capabilities and financial viability of employing passive house building
    standards in multi-family residential projects in Austin, Texas. 
  longContent: >-
    In recent years, passive house-building strategies have emerged as a
    promising avenue to achieve net zero emissions through the use of targeted
    shading, insulation, ventilation, in order to reduce associated building
    energy use. However, while the passive house movement has displayed
    significant growth in recent years, costs remain as one of the foremost
    barriers to implementation, and thus, a considerable portion of this
    research addresses the longterm financial implications of integrating these
    design strategies within multi-family buildings in Austin, Texas. Across
    both simulated mid-rise and low-rise multi-family models, the adoption of
    passive house strategies were shown to decrease building energy use
    intensity (EUI) by 62.13% and 58.95% respectively when compared to
    code-standard models, in addition to displaying a cost benefit ratio of 1.43
    and 2.62, respectively. Air-sealing techniques, specifically reducing
    infiltration from 4.0 air changes per hour (ACH) to the passive house
    prescribed 0.6 (ACH), displayed the greatest reduction in building energy
    use when compared to alternative elements of the passive house program, in
    addition to exhibiting the greatest financial returns over the building
    lifespan.

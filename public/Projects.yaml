    Discover the Austin Future Climate Report 2024—our latest insights on how
    rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns will shape Austin’s
    climate. Explore future scenarios, impacts, and strategies for building a
    resilient city.

    In Austin, climate change is expected to cause hotter summers with more
    frequent heatwaves and fewer cold spells. Precipitation projections have
    high uncertainty, but the rainfall amount is expected to remain relatively
    unchanged. Austin is expected to experience more extremes, more variability
    in climate, and slight increase in windy days (fewer calm days). These
    projections are based on “high” and “business as usual” emission scenarios.
    A “high” emission scenario refers to model projections where emissions from
    human activities are expected to increase. A “business as usual” emission
    scenario considers projections where emissions are considered to remain
    status quo. For the projections, the output is based on medians, not
    averages, and presented for near-future (2021–2040), midcentury (2041–2070)
    and end of the century (2071–2100) epochs.

- title: Passive House Project
  targetSection: passive-house-project
  shortContent: >-
    The Passive House Project delves into both the potential energy saving
    capabilities and financial viability of employing passive house building
    standards in multi-family residential projects in Austin, Texas. 
  longContent: >-
    In recent years, passive house-building strategies have emerged as a
    promising avenue to achieve net zero emissions through the use of targeted
    shading, insulation, ventilation, in order to reduce associated building
    energy use. However, while the passive house movement has displayed
    significant growth in recent years, costs remain as one of the foremost
    barriers to implementation, and thus, a considerable portion of this
    research addresses the longterm financial implications of integrating these
    design strategies within multi-family buildings in Austin, Texas. Across
    both simulated mid-rise and low-rise multi-family models, the adoption of
    passive house strategies were shown to decrease building energy use
    intensity (EUI) by 62.13% and 58.95% respectively when compared to
    code-standard models, in addition to displaying a cost benefit ratio of 1.43
    and 2.62, respectively. Air-sealing techniques, specifically reducing
    infiltration from 4.0 air changes per hour (ACH) to the passive house
    prescribed 0.6 (ACH), displayed the greatest reduction in building energy
    use when compared to alternative elements of the passive house program, in
    addition to exhibiting the greatest financial returns over the building
    lifespan.

- title: Cool Pavement Pilot Study
  targetSection: cool-pavement-study
  shortContent: >-
    Cool pavement is an adaptational strategy aimed to mitigate the effects of
    extreme heat. The City of Austin laid down over 6 lane miles of cool
    pavement in a neighborhood in South East Austin and asked the Co-Lab to
    evaluate it's efficacy. Since the pavement has been laid down the Co-Lab has
    been engaged in various efforts to evaluate this mitigation strategy
    including field measurements, remote sensing, modeling, and social science
    approaches.  
  longContent: >-
    Extreme urban heat has become an intense focus of study for cities as heat
    is the largest weather related killer in the US. One strategy cities have
    been evaluating is reflective pavement. Reflective pavements work by
    increasing the albedo of the road surface to stop the absorption of
    shortwave solar radiation. Other cities have tried to evaluate reflective
    pavements and have so far come up with mixed/ inconclusive results. During
    the summer of 2024 the city of Austin laid down 6.5 lane miles of reflective
    pavements as a pilot project in South East Austin. To evaluate this
    adaptation method several strategies have been utilized. 1. 2- Meter air
    temperature measurements 2. Handheld surface temperature measurements 3.
    Remote sensing based surface temperature measurements 4. A social science
    based blind experiement 5. A survey of local residents. This study is
    currently ongoing and will continue to be updated as more data becomes
    available.

- title: Decision Calendars
  targetSection: decision-calendars
  shortContent: >-
    City departments are reliant on different climate and weather information
    throughout the year for their operations. Decision calendars is a visual
    framework that is  a tool that is tailored to specifc department needs and
    their dependency on climate and weather data.  
  longContent: >-
    Various operations and activities in the city municipal departments are
    weather and climate data sensitive. However, there is limited understanding
    and documentation of how and what datasets and products are required or will
    be useful for the various operations on the daily, weekly, monthly,
    seasonal, annual, and longer timescales. A signature project undertaken by
    the CoLab relates to creation of a Climate Data Decision Calendar (C2D2)
    that is creating a formal framework for the climate data and decision
    pairing. An example of work underway with the Austin Fire Department
    Wildfire Division in developing one such Climate Decision Calendar across
    the city of Austin, central Texas region. The operations are intense during
    the fire season, but are also actively underway year round and require a
    wide range of data at different temporal interval. Additional interactions
    with other departments such as Austin Parks, Austin Public Works, Austin
    Water, and Austin Energy are also underway. The idea is that for each of
    these departments and activities a unique Climate Decision Calendar will be
    developed based off their specific needs and operations, and this
    information collectively will assist in helping broaden the understanding of
    climate data needs, customizing data products, and helping local decision
    making and planning.

    Extreme weather events including hurricanes and extreme rainfalls are
    occurring frequently in the recent decades over all the global basins.
    Sophisticated modeling system enables us to have higher accuracy in for the
    predicting of these events bringing crucial information for the mitigation
    and preparedness strategies. However, the understanding and accurate
    predictability of these high impact weather events pose challenges which
    needs continous research analyzing different feedback systems.

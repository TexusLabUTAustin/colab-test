    Discover the Austin Future Climate Report 2024—our latest insights on how
    rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns will shape Austin’s
    climate. Explore future scenarios, impacts, and strategies for building a
    resilient city.

    In Austin, climate change is expected to cause hotter summers with more
    frequent heatwaves and fewer cold spells. Precipitation projections have
    high uncertainty, but the rainfall amount is expected to remain relatively
    unchanged. Austin is expected to experience more extremes, more variability
    in climate, and slight increase in windy days (fewer calm days). These
    projections are based on “high” and “business as usual” emission scenarios.
    A “high” emission scenario refers to model projections where emissions from
    human activities are expected to increase. A “business as usual” emission
    scenario considers projections where emissions are considered to remain
    status quo. For the projections, the output is based on medians, not
    averages, and presented for near-future (2021–2040), midcentury (2041–2070)
    and end of the century (2071–2100) epochs.

- title: Passive House Project
  targetSection: passive-house-project
  shortContent: >-
    The Passive House Project delves into both the potential energy saving
    capabilities and financial viability of employing passive house building
    standards in multi-family residential projects in Austin, Texas. 
  longContent: >-
    In recent years, passive house-building strategies have emerged as a
    promising avenue to achieve net zero emissions through the use of targeted
    shading, insulation, ventilation, in order to reduce associated building
    energy use. However, while the passive house movement has displayed
    significant growth in recent years, costs remain as one of the foremost
    barriers to implementation, and thus, a considerable portion of this
    research addresses the longterm financial implications of integrating these
    design strategies within multi-family buildings in Austin, Texas. Across
    both simulated mid-rise and low-rise multi-family models, the adoption of
    passive house strategies were shown to decrease building energy use
    intensity (EUI) by 62.13% and 58.95% respectively when compared to
    code-standard models, in addition to displaying a cost benefit ratio of 1.43
    and 2.62, respectively. Air-sealing techniques, specifically reducing
    infiltration from 4.0 air changes per hour (ACH) to the passive house
    prescribed 0.6 (ACH), displayed the greatest reduction in building energy
    use when compared to alternative elements of the passive house program, in
    addition to exhibiting the greatest financial returns over the building
    lifespan.

- title: Cool Pavement Pilot Study
  targetSection: cool-pavement-study
  shortContent: >-
    Cool pavement is an adaptational strategy aimed to mitigate the effects of
    extreme heat. The City of Austin laid down over 6 lane miles of cool
    pavement in a neighborhood in South East Austin and asked the Co-Lab to
    evaluate it's efficacy. Since the pavement has been laid down the Co-Lab has
    been engaged in various efforts to evaluate this mitigation strategy
    including field measurements, remote sensing, modeling, and social science
    approaches.  
  longContent: >-
    Extreme urban heat has become an intense focus of study for cities as heat
    is the largest weather related killer in the US. One strategy cities have
    been evaluating is reflective pavement. Reflective pavements work by
    increasing the albedo of the road surface to stop the absorption of
    shortwave solar radiation. Other cities have tried to evaluate reflective
    pavements and have so far come up with mixed/ inconclusive results. During
    the summer of 2024 the city of Austin laid down 6.5 lane miles of reflective
    pavements as a pilot project in South East Austin. To evaluate this
    adaptation method several strategies have been utilized. 1. 2- Meter air
    temperature measurements 2. Handheld surface temperature measurements 3.
    Remote sensing based surface temperature measurements 4. A social science
    based blind experiement 5. A survey of local residents. This study is
    currently ongoing and will continue to be updated as more data becomes
    available.

- title: Decision Calendars
  targetSection: decision-calendars
  shortContent: >-
    City departments are reliant on different climate and weather information
    throughout the year for their operations. Decision calendars is a visual
    framework that is  a tool that is tailored to specifc department needs and
    their dependency on climate and weather data.  
  longContent: >-
    Various operations and activities in the city municipal departments are
    weather and climate data sensitive. However, there is limited understanding
    and documentation of how and what datasets and products are required or will
    be useful for the various operations on the daily, weekly, monthly,
    seasonal, annual, and longer timescales. A signature project undertaken by
    the CoLab relates to creation of a Climate Data Decision Calendar (C2D2)
    that is creating a formal framework for the climate data and decision
    pairing. An example of work underway with the Austin Fire Department
    Wildfire Division in developing one such Climate Decision Calendar across
    the city of Austin, central Texas region. The operations are intense during
    the fire season, but are also actively underway year round and require a
    wide range of data at different temporal interval. Additional interactions
    with other departments such as Austin Parks, Austin Public Works, Austin
    Water, and Austin Energy are also underway. The idea is that for each of
    these departments and activities a unique Climate Decision Calendar will be
    developed based off their specific needs and operations, and this
    information collectively will assist in helping broaden the understanding of
    climate data needs, customizing data products, and helping local decision
    making and planning.

    ATX CA3TCH UP: Climate Atlas for Accountability and Advocacy Strategies
  targetSection: ATX-CA3TH-UP
  shortContent: >-
    The NASA EEJ project (or climate atlas project) combines community
    experiences with Earth Observation data to create a "Climate Atlas," to
    advance equity and environmental justice in Austin. The Atlas features
    interactive geospatial layers showing multi-hazard risks and social
    vulnerability, local policy information from 2010-2024, and an "Advocacy
    Toolkit" for community action. This comprehensive tool aims to empower
    community groups with better environmental data to effectively advocate for
    addressing neighborhood-specific environmental hazards.
  longContent: >-
    For community groups to advance the arguments and create effective pressure
    points with ATX they need better environmental data. This project combines
    local community experiences and Earth Observation (EO) data to provide a
    more effective means for the city to undertake EJ decisions. Our team from
    GAVA, the City of Austin, and the University of Texas at Austin (UT) is
    integrating satellite data products to advance equity and environmental
    justice. From this work, we will develop a “Climate Atlas.” Concurrently, we
    are conducting an extensive analysis of city council resolutions so that the
    team has a better sense of the underlying inputs and proposed actions
    related to city resolutions related to climate extremes. At the intersection
    of the climate atlas and the policy analysis will be an “advocacy and
    accountability” guide for community groups. We refer to this piece as the
    “Advocacy Toolkit.” The Austin Climate Atlas (“Atlas”) incorporates three
    components: (1) interactive geospatial data layers to explore multi-hazard
    risk exposure alongside social vulnerability data; (2) interactive policy
    information spanning over a decade of extreme growth and extreme weather
    from 2010 to 2024; and, (3) a toolkit that allows communities to use the
    Atlas to advocate for actions to address environmental hazards specific to
    their neighborhood.

    The document details efforts by Go! Austin/Vamos! Austin (GAVA), the City of
    Austin, and the University of Texas to address extreme heat in Austin's
    Eastern Crescent, focusing on vulnerable communities. It highlights
    community engagement, heat mapping, and the development of strategies like
    tree planting, bus shelters, and splash pads to mitigate heat impacts. The
    project emphasizes collaboration with residents to prioritize and implement
    solutions for better climate resilience and health outcomes.
  longContent: >-
    In 2020, University of Texas at Austin, Go! Austin/Vamos! Austin (GAVA), and
    the City of Austin worked together to create a map and understand how hot it
    gets in different parts of Austin, what it’s like to live with it, and how
    it affects our health and activity. These partners were funded by the
    National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) and the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Climate Program Office.
    The research team, led by University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of
    Geoscience researchers, measured air temperature to produce a series of maps
    that the community helped create. This data also helped the team see where
    trees are, areas without shade, and locations of bus stops without shelters.
    Their goal was to bring attention to areas within the city of Austin where
    people live with higher levels of stress impacting their health, experience
    high urban heat temperatures, and lack access to shade. The maps guided the
    team to focus on peoples’ lived experiences with urban heat. These maps help
    the team develop strategies with the community to address urban heat.

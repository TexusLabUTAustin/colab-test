    In Austin, climate change is expected to cause hotter summers with more
    frequent heatwaves and fewer cold spells. Precipitation projections have
    high uncertainty, but the rainfall amount is expected to remain relatively
    unchanged. Austin is expected to experience more extremes, more variability
    in climate, and slight increase in windy days (fewer calm days). These
    projections are based on “high” and “business as usual” emission scenarios.
    A “high” emission scenario refers to model projections where emissions from
    human activities are expected to increase. A “business as usual” emission
    scenario considers projections where emissions are considered to remain
    status quo. For the projections, the output is based on medians, not
    averages, and presented for near-future (2021–2040), midcentury (2041–2070)
    and end of the century (2071–2100) epochs.
